<h1>Arecibo Pulsar and Transient Search of M33</h1>  

<p>

<b>Project Summary</b>

<p>

To date, 99% of all pulsars that have been discovered are located
within the Milky Way and its globular clusters, while the remaining 1%
are in the nearby Magellanic Clouds. Recent developments in observing
technology at the Arecibo telescope now make detection of pulsars
beyond the Magellanic Clouds a promising possibility. One excellent
target to search is the spiral galaxy M33, the Triangulum Galaxy. M33
is only about 15-20 times more distant than the Magellanic Clouds and
it is the third largest galaxy in the Local Group. Past efforts to
detect pulsars in M33 with Arecibo have been unsuccessful (e.g.,
<a href=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...596..982M>McLaughlin &
Cordes 2003</a> and
<a href=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...732...14B>Bhat et
al. 2011</a>), but we have proposed a new and improved search.

<p>

Our leading motivation for this project is to make a groundbreaking
discovery of extragalactic radio pulsars in M33. This would help us
better understand neutron star formation, supernova processes, and
pulsar evolution during early stages in another spiral galaxy.
Pulsars in M33 could also be used to probe the local intergalactic
medium. Apart from bright pulsars, our search may be sensitive to
bright bursts from other sources, such as rotating radio transients
and magnetars. It is also sensitive to the extremely luminous
extragalactic bursts (fast radio bursts, or FRBs) that have been
observed previously in some pulsar surveys. The origin of these bursts
remains unknown.

<p>

Using the Crab pulsar as a guide, we estimate that our observations
using the PUPPI backend at Arecibo at a center frequency of 327 MHz
ought to be sensitive to every Crab-like pulsar residing in the
optical disk of M33 that is beaming in our direction.
