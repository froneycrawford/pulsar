<b>Project Summary</b> 

<p>

The LMC X-ray pulsar PSR J0537-6910 is a young, energetic, and fast
spinning (16 ms) X-ray pulsar that has not been detected as a radio
pulsar.  Various prior search efforts with Parkes were reported by
<a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998MmSAI..69..951C>Crawford et al. (1998)</a>,
<a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...596..982M>McLaughlin and Cordes (2003)</a>,
and
<a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AdSpR..35.1181C>Crawford et al. (2005)</a>.

<p>

A re-analysis of this last and longest observation (11.6 hr of
integration time) using the FETCH and HEIMDALL single pulse analysis
packages has revealed 49 dispersed single radio pulses above a S/N
of 7.  It is not clear if any of these pulses originate from PSR
J0537-6910 itself, and the pulses span a wide range of DMs. All of the
pulses are also fairly weak, with none having S/N above 8.5. There are
also three repeat pulses detected at a DM of 103 pc cm-3, which is within
the LMC DM range).

These results are reported in <a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...968...99C>"Detection of 49 Weak
Dispersed Radio Pulses in a Parkes Observation of the X-ray Pulsar PSR
J0537-6910"</a> by F. Crawford, Astrophysical Journal, 968, 99 (2024).
