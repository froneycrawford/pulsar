<b>Project Summary</b> 

<p>

The LMC X-ray pulsar PSR J0537-6910 is a young, energetic, and fast
spinning (16 ms) X-ray pulsar that has not been detected as a radio
pulsar.  Various prior search efforts with Parkes were reported by
<a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998MmSAI..69..951C>Crawford
et al. (1998)</a>,
<a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...596..982M>McLaughlin
and Cordes (2003)</a>, and
<a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AdSpR..35.1181C>Crawford
et al. (2005)</a>.

<p>

A re-analysis of this last and longest observation (11.6 hr of
integration time) using the FETCH and HEIMDALL single pulse analysis
packages has revealed 49 dispersed single radio pulses above a S/N of
7.  It is not clear if any of these pulses originate from PSR
J0537-6910 itself, and the pulses span a wide range of DMs. All of the
pulses are also fairly weak, with none having S/N above 8.5. There are
also three repeat pulses detected at a DM of 103 pc cm-3, which is
within the LMC DM range).

<p>

These results are reported in
<a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...968...99C>"Detection
of 49 Weak Dispersed Radio Pulses in a Parkes Observation of the X-ray
Pulsar PSR J0537-6910"</a> by F. Crawford, Astrophysical Journal, 968,
99 (2024).

<b>Addendum (March 2025)</b>

<p>
  
A search of two additional archival Parkes observations of PSR
J0537-6910 from 2017 (Project P942) revealed a signal with DM 823 and
S/N of 9.0. This complements two of the pulses detected in the set of
49 in the original file which had DMs of 810 (S/N 8.5) and 839 (S/N
7.3). A comparison of the three signals can be seen in
<a href=./dm800_plots/>these plots</a>.

<p>

All three pulses are weak but have reasonable (and consistent)
morphologies. All three have consistent widths (512 bins,
corresponding to 30-40 ms in each case). However, these widths are
much larger than the 16 ms spin period of PSR J0537-6910 (so, they are
probably not from this pulsar). Could these signals be from a neutron
star at DM of around 800 in the LMC (embedded deep in plasma)?
