<h1>Arecibo Pulsar and Transient Search of the Dwarf Irregular Galaxies Leo A and T</h1>  

<p>

We have conducted an Arecibo 327 MHz search of two dwarf irregular
galaxies in the Local Group, Leo A and T, for radio pulsars and single
pulses from fast radio bursts and other giant pulse emitters. We
detected no astrophysical signals in this search, and we estimate flux
density limits on both periodic and burst emission. Our derived
luminosity limits indicate that only the most luminous radio pulsars
known in our Galaxy and in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) would have been
detectable in our search if they were at the distances of Leo A and
T. Given the much smaller stellar mass content and star formation
rates of Leo A and T compared to the Milky Way and the MCs, there are
likely to be few (if any) extremely luminous pulsars in these
galaxies. It is therefore not surprising that we detected no pulsars
in our search.
