<b> FRB 010724 (the Lorimer Burst) </b>

<p>

F&M was involved in the discovery and analysis of the first of these
bursts reported, FRB 010724 (the Lorimer Burst), which was found in a
Parkes survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud.  For scientific details
about FRB 010724, please consult
<a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007Sci...318..777L> "A Bright
Millisecond Radio Burst of Extragalactic Origin"</a> by D. R. Lorimer
et al., Science, 318, 777 (2007).

<p>

For a layman's explanation, you can read the media report of the
discovery in
<a href=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14778839&ft=1&f=1001><i>Strong
Extragalactic Radio Burst Poses a Mystery</i></a> at NPR's All Things
Considered web site (the radio broadcast of the report is also there,
and you can listen to that).

<p>

Three of our team members on this discovery (Bailes, Lorimer, and McLaughlin)
were also honored with the <a href=https://www.shawprize.org/prizes/astronomy>2023 Shaw Prize in Astronomy</a>. 

<p>

<p>

<b> FRB 121102 (aka "The Repeater") </b>

<p>

F&M was also part of the discovery (and redetection) team for FRB
121102, the only FRB discovered to date with the Arecibo telescope and
the only one observed so far to repeat its burst emission.  For details about
FRB 121102, see
<a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...790..101S>"Fast Radio
Burst Discovered in the Arecibo Pulsar ALFA Survey"</a> by
L. G. Spitler et al., Astrophysical Journal, 790, 101 (2014)

<p>

The first followup detection of multiple bursts from the same source
was published in
<a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016Natur.531..202S>"A Repeating
Fast Radio Burst"</a> by L. G. Spitler et al., Nature, 531, 202
(2016). On the Nature page there is also a nice audio interview with
several researchers about this finding and other recent FRB science.

<p>

outlets, including

Later localization of this burst source using VLA follow-up
observations was reported in <a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Natur.541...58C>"A Direct Localization of a Fast Radio Burst and Its Host"</a> by S. Chatterjee et al., Nature, 541, 58 (2017).

<b> Four FRBs from the Parkes 70-cm Survey Re-Analysis </b>

<p>

We found four new FRBs in a reprocesing of the Parkes 70-cm Survey
for pulsars. The new FRBs have several distinguishing features.

<ul>
    
<li> All four of the FRBs discovered have significantly larger widths (> 50 ms) than
almost all of the FRBs detected and cataloged to date.

<li> One of the FRBs has a DM of 3338 pc cm^-3, which is
the largest DM measured for any FRB to date.

<li> These are the first FRBs detected by any radio telescope (so far), and they predate the Lorimer Burst by almost a decade. 

</ul>
