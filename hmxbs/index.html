<h1>Search of HMXBs in the Magellanic Clouds</h1>  

<p>

The search targets were from the <a
href=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/maghmxbcat.html>Magellanic
Clouds High-Mass X-Ray Binaries Catalog (HEASARC)</a>, built from data
from <a

et al. (2005)</a>

The source XTE J0103-728 (on this list)
was searched previously. The (null) result was presented in
