<h2> Processing Progress: </h2>

<p> Galactic longitude and latitude plot of known pulsars (blue
crosses), beams observed (grey points), and beams processed (red,
orange, yellow, green points). Beams processed are colour-coded based
on the percentage of candidates in that beam that have been
classified. The top plot is the Inner Galaxy. The bottom plot is the
Anti-Centre.</p>

<p>
<b>Colour-code for processed beams:</b><br />
<blockquote>
Red: 0% - 10% classified<br />
Orange: 10% - 25% classified<br />
Yellow: 25% - 50% classified<br />
Green: 50% - 100% classified<br />
</blockquote>

<h2>RFI:</h2>

<p>The grey histogram shows total number of candidates not marked as
RFI per frequency bin (this includes all unclassified candidates). The
pink histogram shows total number of candidates marked as RFI per
frequency bin. The black points are candidates not marked as RFI (this
also includes all unclassified candidates). The red points are
candidates marked as RFI.</p>

<h2>DM vs. Frequency:</h2>

<p>DM vs. Frequency plot similar to the RFI plot, except without
histograms. The black points are candidates not marked at RFI (this
includes all unclassified candidates). The red points are candidates
marked as RFI.</p>

<h2>Processing and Classifications:</h2>

<p>Text information includes total number of beams processed, total
number of beams from grid pointings processed, total number of
candidates produced and total number of candidates produced from grid
pointing beams. The table summarizes the classifications by user. The
plot shows the maximum PRESTO sigma of an unclassified candidate for
each beam.</p>
